<details><summary><strong>Reproduction steps</strong></summary>

<!--
🚩 Required (2 of 2): please replace this comment with a link to a repo
demonstrating your issue *using as few lines of code as possible*. If we can't
reproduce the problem on our side, how can we ever hope to fix it for you 🤷🏾?

If your issue is simple enough that it doesn't warrant a demo repo, include
instead the simplest most basic possible steps to reproduce your problem; e.g.:

1. Clone the dummy repo I made: https://github.com/…
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx jest`
4. See error "xyz" at test 2, which shouldn't be happening
