# * Paths below are ignored by prettier as well as remark and doctoc when called
# * with `symbiote format`.

# ! Note that any pattern with a / in the beginning OR MIDDLE (but not end) will
# ! be considered relative to this file ONLY. Matching subdirs will NOT match!
# ! Otherwise, patterns will match entities in any directory or subdirectory.
# ! Prepend ** (or **/) if advanced subdir matching of complex paths is desired.
